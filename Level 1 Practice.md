Welcome to CW Academy’s Level 1 course. Before you take note of the homework assignments, below, you should understand how we expect you to practice during the eight-week course.

Your course is broken up into 16 sessions corresponding to a twice weekly on-line meeting with your advisors. You are expected to practice the assignment for session 1, for example, before the on-line session 1 so that the advisor can assess your progress and any problems. So, you practice the
session 1 assignments for the days preceding session 1, and then practice the session 2 assignment for the days preceding session 2, and so on.

There are two key tools we use to ensure your success in this course. One is Skype which enables us to meet in a virtual training room two times per week, online. We can see and hear each other, and can hear any code being sent.

But the most important tool is Morse Trainer.To set it up, read “Using Morse Trainer.”Morse Trainer is pre-loaded with your homework assignment segments. You will play them, over and over, until you feel comfortable that you recognize each letter’s and number’s sound pattern.
Note, I did not say each letter’s and number’s dots and dashes or dits and dahs – I said sound pattern. That’s the secret to learning Morse in a way that will scale up in speed as you progress.

So, for example, your first homework assignment is to play the following segments, one at a time, until you feel you can recognize them:

    Segment 1: t t t t t
    Segment 2: e e e e e
    Segment 3: a a a a a
    Segment 4: n n n n n
    Segment 5: tea
    Segment 6: tee
    Segment 7: eat
    Segment 8: ate
    Segment 9: at
    Segment 10: tat
    Segment 11: teen
    Segment 12: neat
    Segment 13: ten
    Segment 14: net
    Segment 15: tan

To enter a segment into Morse Trainer, simply select the session/segment from the menu, then hit “play.” You can repeat a segment by hitting “play” over and over again. When you’re done, select the next segment in place of the previous segment, and continue.

This constitutes your ‘copying’ practice. The key is to learn to recognize a letter or number’s pattern, and then recognize words that use those letters. You will start out by adjusting the speed of Morse Trainer so that letters and words are sent at 20 wpm.

Each homework assignment also has segments for ‘sending’ practice. For example, session 1 has the following sending segments:

    Segment 1: tea
    Segment 2: ten
    Segment 3: net
    Segment 4: tee
What you will do is select a segment, and then play it. Then you will try to imitate it, exactly, using your key or keyer. Repeat it as many times as it takes to feel like you’ve gotten the correct word pattern. For example, “tea” will sound like “dah” space “dit” space “didah.” If you don’t have
enough space, say, between the “t” and “e”, it will sound like “dahdit” “didah.” That is “na” and not “tea.” Timing is everything in sending.

So, before you meet for session 1, you should be able to recognize the patterns of the letters “t”, “e”, “a” and “n.” And you should be able to recognize the patterns of the words “tea,” “ten,” “net,” and “tee.” And, you will be able to do that at 20 wpm!

During your first session, your advisor will be sending those words to you, individually, and seeing if you have learned them. Then, he/she will ask you, individually, to send words to assess how well you’ve learned good element (dit or dah) timing and spacing.

You probably realize, now, that most of your time and effort will be spent using Morse Trainer BEFORE each session, and the session is primarily used for assessment and constructive suggestions.

You will find that you should be spending at least 30 minutes per day, including session days, broken up into 15 minute periods. But take as long as you need to feel comfortable that you’ve ‘gotten’ the copying and sending segments down before each session.

Okay, now that you know what’s expected of you, here are the homework assignments organized by session and segment.
